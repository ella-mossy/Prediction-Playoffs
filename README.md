## Usage Example

### 1. Create a Tournament
```clarity
;; Create a prediction market for a sports match
(contract-call? .prediction-playoffs create-tournament
    "Lakers vs Celtics"
    "NBA Finals Game 7 - Who will win?"
    "basketball"
    u5000000    ;; 5 STX entry
    u288        ;; ~2 days to predict
    u72         ;; ~12 hours to resolve
    u2          ;; 2 teams
)
;; Returns: (ok u0) - tournament ID 0
```

### 2. Users Make Predictions
```clarity
;; User 1 predicts Lakers (outcome 0)
(contract-call? .prediction-playoffs make-prediction u0 u0)

;; User 2 predicts Celtics (outcome 1)
(contract-call? .prediction-playoffs make-prediction u0 u1)

;; User 3 predicts Lakers (outcome 0)
(contract-call? .prediction-playoffs make-prediction u0 u0)
```

### 3. Check Tournament Status
```clarity
;; View tournament details
(contract-call? .prediction-playoffs get-tournament u0)

;; Check total on each outcome
(contract-call? .prediction-playoffs get-outcome-total u0 u0)  ;; Lakers total
(contract-call? .prediction-playoffs get-outcome-total u0 u1)  ;; Celtics total

;; Check your potential winnings
(contract-call? .prediction-playoffs calculate-potential-winnings u0 tx-sender)
```

### 4. Resolve Tournament
```clarity
;; Creator resolves after the game (Lakers won = outcome 0)
(contract-call? .prediction-playoffs resolve-tournament u0 u0)
```

### 5. Claim Winnings
```clarity
;; Winners claim their share
(contract-call? .prediction-playoffs claim-winnings u0)
```

## Prize Distribution Logic

The prize pool is distributed proportionally based on stake:

```
User Winnings = (Total Pool √ó User Stake) √∑ Total Stake on Winning Outcome
```

**Example:**
- Total Pool: 15 STX (3 users √ó 5 STX entry)
- Outcome 0 (Lakers) total stake: 10 STX (User 1 + User 3)
- Outcome 1 (Celtics) total stake: 5 STX (User 2)
- Lakers win!

Winners:
- User 1: (15 √ó 5) √∑ 10 = **7.5 STX**
- User 3: (15 √ó 5) √∑ 10 = **7.5 STX**

## Error Codes

| Code | Constant | Description |

| u106 | err-already-predicted | User already made a prediction |
| u107 | err-insufficient-funds | Not enough STX to pay entry fee |
| u108 | err-not-resolved | Tournament not yet resolved |

## Best Practices

1. **Set Reasonable Durations**
   - Allow enough time for participation
   - Consider event timing for resolution

2. **Clear Outcome Definitions**
   - Document what each outcome number represents
   - Use unambiguous criteria

3. **Fair Entry Fees**
   - Balance accessibility with prize value
   - Consider your target audience

4. **Timely Resolution**
   - Resolve tournaments promptly after events
   - Maintain trust with participants

5. **Transparent Communication**
   - Use clear titles and descriptions
   - Specify resolution criteria upfront

## Security Considerations

- **Creator Trust**: Tournament creators must resolve honestly
- **Time Locks**: Prevents premature predictions and resolutions
- **No Oracles**: Relies on creator's honest resolution
- **Single Prediction**: Prevents gaming the system
- **Immutable Stakes**: Cannot change prediction after submission

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future versions:
- Multi-sig resolution (community voting)
- Oracle integration for automated resolution
- Tournament categories with verification
- Reputation system for creators
- Partial refunds for cancelled tournaments
- Support for multiple predictions per user
- Leaderboards and statistics
